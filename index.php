        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <div>
            <p>We are a fairly new organization, we started back in 2021 with a focus on Rocket League in the Indy Gaming League. 
            We have teams ranking from platinum, all the way up to high GC teams. We are always welcoming anyone into our organization to either play for us, 
            help out with administration, or even just to chat it up. We are so thankful to everyone who has helped out already, 
            and to you for even being here on the website. Check us out on social media, join the discord, or contact us for inquires. 
            We look forward to hearing from you! #TheSkysTheLimit</p>
